# Linear Regression Salary Prediction Project

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive linear regression model designed to predict employee salaries based on several key factors including age, years of experience, job title indicators, gender, and education level.

## Objective
The main goal of this analysis is to understand how various factors influence employee salaries and to develop a predictive model that explains salary variation effectively.

## Dataset
The dataset contains employee information including:
- Age
- Years of Experience
- Job Titles (converted to indicator variables)
- Gender
- Education Level
- Salary (target variable)

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing were conducted to handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
- Feature engineering was applied to create relevant indicators from job titles.
- Linear regression modeling was performed using Python’s libraries to quantify the impact of each predictor on salary.
- Model performance was evaluated using R-squared and statistical significance tests for predictors.

## Results
- The model achieved an **R-squared of 0.921**, explaining over 92% of the variation in employee salaries.
- All predictors were found to be statistically significant, highlighting their strong relationship with salary.
- The model provides actionable insights for HR strategic planning, compensation benchmarking, and talent management.

## Conclusion
This salary prediction model is not only statistically robust but also highly interpretable, making it a valuable tool for forecasting salaries and supporting data-driven decisions in workforce management.
